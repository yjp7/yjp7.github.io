I received B.Eng. degree in optoelectronic information science and engineering from Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China, in 2021. 

Presently, I am a PhD Student at Zhejiang University, co-advised by Prof. [Zhihai Xu](https://person.zju.edu.cn/0089108#0) and Prof. [Huajun Feng](https://person.zju.edu.cn/0086127). My research direction centers on the synergy of advanced  optical zooming systems and computer vision, with the aim of exploring diverse potential application domains.

**Research interest:** Computational Photography, Deep Learning, Low-level Computer Vision, Optical Zooming System and Advanced Imaging Devices.
